## Abstact

Usually, the parameters of a Weibull distribution are estimated by maximum likelihood estimation. To reduce the biases of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of two-parameter Weibull distributions, we propose analytic bias-corrected MLEs. Two other common estimators of Weibull distributions, least-squares estimators and percentiles estimators, are also introduced. Based on a comparison of their performances in the simulation study, we strongly recommend the analytic bias-corrected MLEs for the parameters of Weibull distributions, especially when the sample size is small.
